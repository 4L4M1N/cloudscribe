these instructions are work in progress there are still some unfinished things, this isn'y working at the moment

create a new asp.net web application project in VS
in the dialog for the project template choose Empty, don't check any of the checkboxes, and click ok.

in VS go to Tools > NuGet Package Manager > Package Manager Settings
in the left pane click on Package Sources
in the top right click the plus
at the bottom set the name as cloudscribe-test and set the source as
http://download.mojoportal.com/nug/nuget
click ok to save and close the dialog

right click the empty web application project node in Solution Explorer, and choose Manage NuGet Packages...

Currently we're having some problems with NuGet not resolving a few dependencies and this causes the cloudscribe installation to abort and rollback.
For the moment, the following dependencies have been removed form our list of dependencies and should be installed separately, ideally before installing cloudscribe
in the left pane of Package Manager click Online, then click the feed for nuget.org
install the following packages before moving on to install cloudscribe

jQuery version 2.1.3
jQuery.UI.Combined version 1.11.2
jQuery.Validation version 1.13.1
Microsoft.jQuery.Unobtrusive.Ajax version 3.2.2
Microsoft.jQuery.Unobtrusive.Validation version 3.2.2


in the left pane of Package Manager click Online, then click the feed for cloudscribe-test
you should see a lot of packages, the one you want is named cloudscribe.Core.Web, it is probably on the second page
click the cloudscribe.Core.Web.Integration package to highlight it, then click Install

We keep getting gateway timeout error on some packages, but seems we're not the only ones
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/28288328/nuget-the-remote-server-returned-an-error-504-gateway-timeout

Another apparent NuGet problem is with the Microsoft.jQuery.Unobtrusive.Validation version 3.2.2
it cvauses this error
Updating 'jQuery 2.1.3' to 'jQuery 1.4.1' failed. Unable to find a version of 'Microsoft.jQuery.Unobtrusive.Validation' that is compatible with 'jQuery 1.4.1'.

For some reason it wants to "upgrade" jquery from 2.1.3 to 1.4.1 

Things to fix
cloudscribe.Resources.dll did not get installed in the bin folder
	
We need to update appSettings with file="Web.AppSettings.config"
	
We also need to add the DbProvider factories in Web.config
