To work with the solution use Visual Studio 2013 Professional Update 4

The WebHost project is the web application project, it must be the startup project in the solution.

Copy the file Web.AppSettings.config.sample in the WebHost project and rename it as Web.AppSettings.config

Create an MS SQL database with sql authentication and set the connection string in the Web.AppSettings.config file

Rebuild the solution in Visual Studio 2013, that should pull in all the needed packages from NuGet as well as compiling the code.

Right click the WebHost project and choose View > View In Browser

if needed go into the project properties for WebHost and configure the Web settings, optionally use IIS if you have it, otherwise IIS Express.

Once the site is open in the Web Browser, visit /Setup 

After that you should be able to login as admin@admin.com with the password admin

When you do login as admin a new Menu Item for Administration should appear at the top of the page.

optionally, visit /glimpse.axd to turn on Glimpse, which allows you to see a lot of information about the request and hits to the database.

This is a work in progress, many things are not ready for prime time yet. See also ProjectGoals.txt but understand that we have not yet achieved all those goals, we are in early stages of development.
