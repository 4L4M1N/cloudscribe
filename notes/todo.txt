TODO:

Make sure all the Security Settings under Administration > Security Settings are implemented
Some of them may currently just update the settigns but no logic enforces the settings



Check "Require Confirmed Email" && provide smtp settings so email can be sent for verification
** Newly registered user should not be able to login until the email is verified
** Newly registered user should be able to re-request the verification email to be sent
** This should be true even if using social auth to create the account

Check "Require Confirmed Phone" && provide SMS settings
** Newly registered user should not be able to login until phone is verified by sms
** User should have an opportunity to provide a phone number during registration

Check "Require Approval Before Login"
** Newly registered user should not be able to login until an admin approves the account

Check "Only Use Social Authentication" and configure social auth
** The only way for new users to register or for any user to login should be via social auth
** definitely the admin needs to add a social auth to his own account before making this setting or he will have no way to login without changing it in the db back to allow regular login
** I think we still want a visible "Register" link, but the Register action should redirect to login in this case










Phase 2 Plans
Support for IdentityServer4 - main goal is I should be able to mix and mingle SPA features into the same web app with MVC features, and jwt auth works in addition to cookie auth

Telemetry - I would like to implement telemetry to capture activities, but I want an abstraction of my own as opposed to being strongly coupled to Application Insights
I want to be able to log activities to an activity stream - ie into a CRM - there should be interfaces for this in cloudscribe core, but implementation will be outside or can use Application Insights

Need some kind of help system to add contextual help for various settings that may need explanation
