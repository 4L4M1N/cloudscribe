TODO:

Make sure all the Security Settings under Administration > Security Settings are implemented
Some of them may currently just update the settigns but no logic enforces the settings

2016-06-15 Tested
Uncheck "Really Delete Users" - then delete a user
** He should still exist in the db, but does not appear in the user list, he is flagged as IsDeleted = true
** He should not be able to login - failed





Phase 2 Plans
Support for IdentityServer4 - main goal is I should be able to mix and mingle SPA features into the same web app with MVC features, and jwt auth works in addition to cookie auth

Telemetry - I would like to implement telemetry to capture activities, but I want an abstraction of my own as opposed to being strongly coupled to Application Insights
I want to be able to log activities to an activity stream - ie into a CRM - there should be interfaces for this in cloudscribe core, but implementation will be outside or can use Application Insights
