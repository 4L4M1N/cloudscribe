TODO:

Make sure all the Security Settings under Administration > Security Settings are implemented
Some of them may currently just update the settigns but no logic enforces the settings

2016-06-15 Tested
Uncheck "Really Delete Users" - then delete a user
** He should still exist in the db, but does not appear in the user list, he is flagged as IsDeleted = true
** He should not be able to login 
** Currently only way to see a user flagged as deleted is dorectly in the db, not in the UI
** Changing back to checked on Really Delete Users does not delete existing rows flagged as deleted
-- end tested 2016-06-15

2016-06-16 Tested
Uncheck "Allow New Registrations"
** Register links should not be visible
** It should not be possible to register by visiting /Account/Register - returns 404

Uncheck "Allow Persistent Login"
** Remember me should not appear on login page
** Auth cookie should expire when the browser is closed

Uncheck "Use Email for Login"
** Login page label should show username as opposed to email
** should not be possible to login using email
** Register page should show input for username

-- end tested 2016-06-16

Check "Require Confirmed Email" && provide smtp settings so email can be sent for verification
** Newly registered user should not be able to login until the email is verified
** Newly registered user should be able to re-request the verification email to be sent

Check "Require Confirmed Phone" && provide SMS settings
** Newly registered user should not be able to login until phone is verified by sms
** User should have an opportunity to provide a phone number during registration

Check "Require Approval Before Login"
** Newly registered user shoul dnot be able to login until an admin approves the account

Check "Only Use Social Authentication" and configure social auth
** The only way for new users to register or for any user to login should be via social auth
** definitely the admin needs to add a social auth to his own account before making this setting or he will have no way to login without changing it in the db back to allow regular login











Phase 2 Plans
Support for IdentityServer4 - main goal is I should be able to mix and mingle SPA features into the same web app with MVC features, and jwt auth works in addition to cookie auth

Telemetry - I would like to implement telemetry to capture activities, but I want an abstraction of my own as opposed to being strongly coupled to Application Insights
I want to be able to log activities to an activity stream - ie into a CRM - there should be interfaces for this in cloudscribe core, but implementation will be outside or can use Application Insights

Need some kind of help system to add contextual help for various settings that may need explanation
