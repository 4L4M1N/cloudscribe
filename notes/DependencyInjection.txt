Since there will be built in dependency injection in aspnet vnext I think we will use that instead of ninject

Need to figure out how to inject logging. Seems like there are some issues injecting log4net for example because we want a typed logger to know what component is logging. if we just make a wrapper it will never know what component is doing the logging.

maybe there are ways around that

maybe we should consider nlog

in vnext/aspnet 5 owin there is startup code like this:
 // Configure is called after ConfigureServices is called.
        public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IHostingEnvironment env, ILoggerFactory loggerfactory)
        {
            // Configure the HTTP request pipeline.
            // Add the console logger.
            loggerfactory.AddConsole();

maybe we will be able to plugin log4net or other logger there?
