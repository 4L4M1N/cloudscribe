# unsolved problem 1
For some reason jquery unobtrusive validation is preventing form submission
in Views/Sys/Account/Register.cshtml
so I had to comment out the js
@* @Scripts.Render("~/bundles/jqueryval")  *@  

What I don't understand is
Views/Sys/UserAdmin/EditUser.cshtml
is almost identical but there the jquery unobtrusive validation works just fine.
both views use the same ViewModel and the same partial view for most of the inputs.

the rendered source is almost identical just different form action
