This is a place to make notes of doubts or questions about how something is implemented and whether there is a better way it should be done.

Is SiteAdmin controller too big? Should things like Role and Role Member Management be moved to a different controller?
I'm thinking probably yes, but I do kind of like the url /SiteAdmin/Roles which makes it work with the existing route and matches the breadcrumbs.
