## Testing

using the shop app sample, when I run polymer test, which internally uses selenium, it fails with an error saying java is not installed in your path, please install java.

I don't want to install effing java on my machine.

apparently it is using the java web driver
but it looks like maybe c# bindings can be used instead

need to investigate whether that is possible
